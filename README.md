# Ruby Connect-4

### Overview

Creating the game engine for connect-4 via
[Bitboards](https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md)
in Ruby.

The above Bitboards link is to a high level discussion on how
to use Bitboards via psudo-code. When searching the internets
I didn't find an example written in Ruby. 

This is that example.
